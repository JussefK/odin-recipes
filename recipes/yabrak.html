    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Yabrak (also known as stuffed grape leaves or dolma in some regions) is a delicious and flavorful dish popular in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines.<br>
    Here's a classic recipe for Yabrak:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup short-grain rice, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>250g ground lamb or beef (optional for vegetarian version)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium tomato, finely diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh mint, finely chopped (or 1 teaspoon dried mint)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 jar (about 200g) grape leaves in brine, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>Juice of 2 lemons</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken or vegetable stock (or water)</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the rice, ground meat (if using), onion, tomato, parsley, mint, tomato paste, allspice, cinnamon, salt, pepper, and olive oil until well combined.</li>
        <li>
            Rinse the grape leaves thoroughly to remove excess brine.<br>
            Trim any thick stems from the leaves.</li>
        <li>Lay a grape leaf shiny side down on a flat surface.<br>
            Place about 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon of filling (depending on the leaf size) near the base of the leaf.<br>
            Fold in the sides and roll tightly into a small cylinder, like a cigar. Repeat with the remaining leaves and filling.
        </li>
        <li>
            Line the bottom of a large pot with tomato slices or a few unused grape leaves to prevent sticking.<br>
            Arrange the stuffed grape leaves seam side down in tight layers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the olive oil and lemon juice over the grape leaves.<br>
            Add garlic slices and stock (or water) to cover the leaves.<br>
            Place a plate or heatproof dish on top to keep the rolls from unraveling.<br>
            Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer gently for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the rice is cooked.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let the yabrak cool slightly before transferring to a serving dish.<br>
            Serve warm or at room temperature with a side of yogurt or a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.
        </li>
    </ol>
