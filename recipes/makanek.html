    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Makanek is a traditional Lebanese sausage dish, packed with spices and flavor. <br> 
        It's often served as part of a mezze platter. Here's a simple recipe to make Makanek from scratch:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g ground lamb or beef (or a mix of both)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground allspice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for a spicy kick)</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pomegranate molasses</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>Pine nuts, toasted</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the ground meat with all the spices, garlic, pomegranate molasses, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Knead the mixture until well combined and slightly sticky. This ensures the sausages hold together while cooking.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate the mixture for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to meld (or overnight for deeper flavor).</li>
        <li>Wet your hands with a bit of water or oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Take small portions of the meat mixture and shape them into small, finger-sized sausages (about 5 cm long).</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the sausages in batches, ensuring they aren’t overcrowded.</li>
        <li>Cook for 4–5 minutes on each side, until browned and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Once all the sausages are cooked, squeeze the lemon juice over them in the skillet and toss gently to coat.</li>
        <li>Transfer the Makanek to a serving dish and garnish with parsley and toasted pine nuts, if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with pita bread and a side of tahini sauce or pickled vegetables.</li>
    </ol>
